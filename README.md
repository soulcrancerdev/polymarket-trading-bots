## 📈 Popular Copy Trading Strategies

1. **🏗️ Build a Portfolio of Traders**
   - 🌐 Diversify across 3-5 traders with expertise in specific markets (e.g., sports, politics, crypto).
   - 📉 Analyze wallet history: P&L curve, win rate, risk-reward, max drawdown.
   - ⭐ Use "Copy Score" (e.g., R² * win rate * profit factor) to rank traders.
   - 🚫 Avoid loud whales; target small quants with steady profits.

2. **📊 Proportional Sizing and Risk Limits**
   - 🔄 Mirror trades proportionally (e.g., if whale risks 5% of $1M, you risk 5% of your portfolio).
   - 🛑 Cap risk at 7% per trade, max 3 open positions.
   - 🧪 Start small (0.1% allocation) for testing.

3. **⚙️ Custom Bot Parameters**
   - 🚫 Skip certain markets or categories.
   - 🔢 Set size multipliers based on trade size/category (e.g., chase spreads for high-volume trades).
   - 🔄 Use retries with FAK/GTD orders; adjust for live vs. non-live markets.
   - 📏 Copy % (e.g., 50-100% of trader's size).

4. **🎯 Target Specific Trader Types**
   - 🤖 **AI Sentiment Bots**: Copy bots that profit from news reactions (5-20 min window).
   - 🔄 **Mean Reversion Bots**: Follow bots snapping up panic dumps.
   - 💎 **Undervaluation Traders**: Mirror those betting on low-attention, mispriced markets (e.g., lower leagues).
   - 📉 **Low/High Price Specialists**: Copy low-entry (0.1¢) high-frequency or high-entry (99¢) near-resolution plays.

5. **🗃️ Wallet Baskets Approach**
   - 👥 Group 5-10 similar wallets; enter only when 80%+ align on the same outcome within a tight price range.

6. **✅ Pre-Copy Checklist**
   - 🖐️ Trade manually first (10-20 trades) to understand risk.
   - 👀 Observe 5-10 trades before automating.
   - 🧠 Match trader expertise to your interests (e.g., skip NHL if unfamiliar).
   - 💧 Ensure liquid markets (min $1M volume) to avoid moving prices.

7. **🔥 Advanced Tips**
   - 🔗 Combine with domain specialization (10-20% allocation).
   - ⚠️ Monitor for adverse selection: Ensure your slippage + fees < trader's edge per share.
   - 📚 Learn from failures: Avoid being exit liquidity or news traps.
